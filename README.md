#Project Title : SANI (Semantic Assistance with Neural Intelligence)#

Problem Statement :

- A person hesitates to share their feelings and emotions because of a communication breakdown.

-  Many people don't share their problems due to social pressure.

-  Eventually, this transforms into a vicious cycle of endless suffering. 

-  It leads a person on the path to mental health disorders.

-  In many cases, the person attempts suicide to end the suffering..

Our Approach : 

-  In our program, any person can express their feelings through various modes of communication like voice and text.

-  As user shares their problem, the AI will initiate communication with the user. 

- According to the input given, AI will provide the user with appropriate solutions. 

- We aim to create a program that can be approached anytime just like a true friend.
